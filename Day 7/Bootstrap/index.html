            Bootstrap is a popular open-source front-end framework used for developing responsive and mobile-first
            websites and web applications. It was originally created by Twitter and released in 2011. Bootstrap provides
            a collection of CSS and JavaScript components that help developers build modern, responsive web pages
            quickly and efficiently.

            Key Features:
            Responsive Grid System: Bootstrap’s grid system allows developers to create complex, responsive layouts with
            ease. The grid is based on a 12-column system that can be customized to fit different screen sizes and
            devices. This makes it simple to design websites that look good on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
